How to use the scripting language:

script_start			// Tells the script where to start, and also adds it to the array of active scripts
script_tick				// Tells the script where to start running the code when a tick occurs
script_end				// Ends the script and removes it from the array of active scripts
return					// Ends the script without removing it from the array of active scripts

goto <int lineNum>		// Jumps the line's current reading point to the specified line number
goto <string label>		// Same as before, but jumps to a label defined by the scripter
@somelabel				// Defines a label. If called by goto, the current reading point will jump to this point

if X>=Y {				// \
						// | If block. Works as excepted. Supports ==, >=, <=, !=, >, <
}						// /

$x=0					// Defines a variable "x" to 0.0, all variables are floats
$x+1.5					// Basic arithmatic is supportes. This is equivalent to x += 1.5f; in java
							// The supported operators are:
$x+0.1						// + (addition)
$x-1.5						// - (subtraction),
$x*1.5						// * (multiplication)
$x/1.5						// / (division)
$x%1.5						// % (modulus)

$x=fps					// There are also special values that variables can be set to. These are read only
							// All usable values are:
							// fps 			(framerate)
							// fov 			(field of view)
							// delta_time	(delta time of tickrate)
							// gravity		(gravity)
							
debug true				// \
log asdfg				// / Any console commands written in the script will be sent to the console and executed
